    <h1>childhood</h1>
    <p>
      Donaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of
      13, under the name of "MrBeast6000".[41] His early content ranged from
      Let's Plays, mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty: Black Ops
      II,[41] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[42] videos that
      offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators, and commentary on YouTube
      drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[41] In July 2013,
      the subscriber count of his channel, then named "That-dude", was around
      240.[43] In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his
      "Worst intros on YouTube" series poking fun at YouTube video
      introductions.[44][non-primary source needed] By mid-2016, Donaldson had
      around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East
      Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][42]
      His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family
      home.[37]

      As his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends Chris Tyson,
      Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin to contribute to his
      channel.[37] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain
      statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's
      recommendation system.[45][clarification needed] Franklin left the crew in
      2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to
      take his place.[46][47][48]

      In January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself
      counting to 100,000.[49] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts
      sped up to "keep it under 24 hours."[49] Donaldson gained popularity
      during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a
      hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[38] attempting to stay
      underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and
      an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[50] By 2018,
      Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which
      earned him the title of "YouTube's biggest philanthropist".[37] During the
      PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the
      most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and
      numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more
      subscribers than T-Series.[51][52] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought
      multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out "Sub 2
      PewDiePie."[53][54] In March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a
      real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of
      $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each
      game) in collaboration with Apex Legends.[55] The event and prize pool was
      sponsored by Apex Legends publisher Electronic Arts.[56] Donaldson was
      accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled "I Opened A FREE
      BANK", published on November 23, 2019.[37] He later explained that he used
      fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants
      received real checks after the shoot.[37 In April 2020, Donaldson created
      a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers
      and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's
      most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[57] The
      event was won by Nadeshot.[58] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another
      influencer tournament featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of
      $300,000. The tournament was won by the D'Amelio family, which caused
      controversy due to claims that they cheated.[59] On January 1, 2021,
      Donaldson released the video "Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's
      Over".[60] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed
      that YouTubers "should get more say in Rewind," and with this in mind, he
      decided to call "hundreds of YouTubers".[60] At the end of the video,
      Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind
      as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[60] A month later, Donaldson
      signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with
      Jellysmack.[61][62] In November 2021, Donaldson uploaded a recreation of
      the survival drama streaming television series Squid Game in real life, in
      which 456 people competed for a $456,000 cash prize, without the violence
      in the show.[63] The video has more than 325 million views as of December
      24, 2022,[64] making it Donaldson's most-viewed YouTube video and making
      it one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021.[65] A review of the
      video in Vice stated that it "badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist
      message of Squid Game".[66] In December 2021, Donaldson created a third
      influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of
      $1,000,000.[67][68][69] In January 2022, Forbes ranked Donaldson as
      YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in
      2021. Forbes stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in
      the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and
      Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[70][71]
